Trying to build a webapp for my friends 

Mission:

A user creates an account, logs in, sees today’s 5 NBA players, answers 10 head-to-head “Who’s better right now?” questions, and then sees:

Their implied ranking of those 5

An ability to choose how / why they made that list (stats, legacy, that boy nice)

A score for how well they align with the overall crowd and along those cats

Global leaderboards for players and users
